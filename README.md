# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The purpose of this analysis was to discover the impact that both the launch date and the goal amount set for a Kickstarter campaign has on its potential success.

### Outcomes Based on Goals

# Analysis
Challenges I faced during  this project were mostly technical and trying to get the information sorted in Excel, this could have posed a much bigger problem if I hadn’t noticed it because an issue in a formula or not referencing the proper sheet/column/row can throw off data and not give you any helpful information. There were a few times that I had to go back and correct formulas used in my Excel sheets.  
Two things I can conclude from the Theater Outcomes based on launch date info is that the best time to try and get funding for a campaign for plays is some time around mid-year, particularly around May and June because the success of Kickstarters that began around this time is extremely high. On the flipside, trying to get a campaign funded in the latter part of the year during Nov. and Dec. is likely to lead to a failed campaign, as many of the projects that began around this time were not successful.  
I can conclude from looking at the Outcomes Based on Goals info that there is a sweet spot for funding below $15,000, when goals went beyond that, their relative chance of success tended to fall quickly.  
Some limitations of this dataset are that it is exclusively Kickstarter information, there are other forms of crowdfunding that out potential client could use that would skew much more heavily in her favor (or perhaps in the other direction). Another limitation is that we do not know if any of the campaigns had stretch goals that incentivized investors or if there was another factor that influenced success such as communication from the project leader to the backers.  
Other tables and graphs we could create could be one to evaluate success of kickstarters over time to see if there was a particular time that they were more successful. During this time of Covid, people do more online shopping and will probably hear more about crowdfunding projects and would be more likely to back it. Or during the housing crash and people weren’t as frivolous with their spending the success of Kickstarters probably wasn’t as high, perhaps it has been trending up or down over the last few years.
